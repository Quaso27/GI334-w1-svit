"Icons: Strategic Resources & Goods"
by David Baumgart

Richly detailed, hand-painted resource icons suitable for a strategy game, RPG, or board game-like experience. The intent of this set is, basically, to cover the requirements of a high-level "map game". May or may not be inspired in part by a certain long-running history-themed turn based game series.

- 85 icons (so far!)
- all icons are 128x128 pixels
- provided on a transparent background for maximum flexibility


Icons include various metals, foods & food sources, natural resources, and a few crafted/manufactured goods. 

Icons are provided as individual transparent-background PNG files.

Feel free to email me and suggest more icons if you have any ideas.
