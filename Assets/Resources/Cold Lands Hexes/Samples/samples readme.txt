"Painted 2D Terrain Hexes: Basic Set"            - http://u3d.as/mZG
"Painted 2D Location Hexes: Medieval-Fantasy"    - http://u3d.as/oZ7
"Cold Lands: Painted 2D Terrain Hexes"           - http://u3d.as/wkt
"Painted 2D Terrain Hexes: Deserts"              - http://u3d.as/KZb
"Painted 2D Terrain Hexes: Tropics and Wetlands" - http://u3d.as/12zZ
"Painted 2D Terrain Hexes: Volcanic Wastes"      - http://u3d.as/12Gr

Feel free to use any of these sample tiles as-is. If you think they're cool and want more, check out the sets on the Unity Asset Store at the links above!
